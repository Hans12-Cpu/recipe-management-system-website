# Recipe Management System

This is a simple **Recipe Management System** built using HTML, CSS (via Bootstrap), and JavaScript. It allows users to view, add, and manage recipes within a dynamic, responsive interface. The application displays recipes in a card format, and users can add new recipes using a modal form.

## Features
- **Responsive Layout**: Designed to work on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices using Bootstrap's grid system.
- **View Recipes**: Display all recipes in a grid layout with an image, name, and description.
- **Add Recipe**: Users can add a new recipe by filling out a form with details such as recipe name, description, image URL, ingredients, and instructions.
- **Dynamic Recipe List**: New recipes added through the form are displayed in the recipe list without reloading the page.
